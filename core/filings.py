"""
SEC EDGAR filing fetcher — pulls Risk Factors (Item 1A) and MD&A
(Item 7 for 10-K / Item 2 for 10-Q) sections from a company's most recent
10-K and 10-Q, for RAG grounding in stock analysis.

Free, no API key. SEC does require a descriptive User-Agent identifying
the requester (SEC_EDGAR_CONTACT env var) per its fair-access policy —
set this to "YourApp yourreal@email.com", or requests get rate-limited
or blocked.

Section extraction is best-effort regex over the filing's plain text.
Filers format 10-Ks/10-Qs inconsistently, so a section that can't be
confidently isolated is skipped rather than indexed as garbage.
